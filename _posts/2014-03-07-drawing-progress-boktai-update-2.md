Another quick update: since last time I have started working on the Doom-style lettering at the top. I've also added more lighting from different directions (fill light and rim light as I talked about in the previous post) and fixed up some of the darker bits in the light coming out of the gun.

Have a look:

I've also started sketching out the elements I want to put around Django, including Otenko (the sunflower, his mentor) and some of the enemies and UI from the game. A photo below:

Stay tuned!
