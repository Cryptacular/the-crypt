I&#8217;d like to present to you: Gustavo Fring from Breaking Bad. I recently watched this show from start to end and it was fantastic! As many of you know, they won a number of Emmys recently and I believe they completely deserved it.

In light of this amazing show, I&#8217;ve created this portrait of Gustavo Fring, owner of Los Pollos Hermanos and drug lord. He is a Chilean national, who spent some time in Mexico to get his foot in the door of the methamphetamine drug trade. Later, he founds and builds up a fast-food chain &#8211; Los Pollos Hermanos &#8211; which he uses as a curtain for his drug business.

As he spent time in Mexico and has daily contact with Mexicans, I drew the left side of this portrait in a stylised form of Mexican Day of the Dead skulls. It is also a reference to a certain episode of a certain season, which I will let you figure out so as to avoid spoilers ;)
