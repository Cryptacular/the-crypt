I drew this for my one year anniversary with my girlfriend Olivia. She's amazing. ;)

The yellow umbrella is a reference to a show we were both watching religiously at the time: How I Met Your Mother. Olivia is wearing a particular shirt and pair of pants she owns in real life and the same with myself.

Created in Photoshop.
