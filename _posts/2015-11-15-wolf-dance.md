This is the Wolf Dance. It is inspired by a short story that a good friend of mine is working on. The idea is that the girl summoned the wolf spirit for her protection by dancing.

There are some links between the girl and the wolf, the most obvious of which is that their eyes are glowing in the same way. The girl is also wearing a necklace with glowing eyes, and there is a glowing wolf symbol on her hand.

She wears a blindfold because she is in complete control of the wolf, and maybe even needs it for focus.

It started off as the following sketch:
