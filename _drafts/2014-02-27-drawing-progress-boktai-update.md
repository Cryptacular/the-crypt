[<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-251" alt="Boktai of Doom WIP 2" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/wp-uploads/2014/02/boktai-of-doom-v3-259x300.jpg" width="259" height="300" />][1]Slowly but surely my Doom cover-style Boktai drawing is coming along. I've added more shading, based on a weak light-source in the top-right of the image. I've repainted the hair to look more natural and I've redone some of the line art. I've also changed the lettering to the Doom font, through a little plugin I found <a href="http://fontmeme.com/doom-font/" target="_blank">here</a>.

<!--more More after the break!-->

Next: I will add shading based on a fill light (possibly located in the middle-left of the image), shading based on a rim light (located behind Django) and I will of course add colour and texture to the &#8220;Boktai&#8221; text, similar to the Doom cover, and make the letters 3-dimensional.
