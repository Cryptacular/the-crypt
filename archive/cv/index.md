## <a name="personal-summary"></a>Personal Summary

My name is Nick Mertens and I'm a hard-working, creative, loyal and honest guy, with a good sense of humour. I have developed a keen interest in web development, after starting my career as an email marketer. As I learned the ropes of email marketing and its very strange coding practices, I started leaning increasingly more towards front end development, as it’s an area that is constantly and quickly evolving. Now I'm steadily increasing my front end development knowledge and skills, as well as learning about back end development in .NET MVC, using C#, and Xamarin Forms for mobile application development.

Currently I’m employed at Fisher & Paykel Healthcare as a Software Developer. Besides working with HTML, LESS and JavaScript (using Kendo UI), we mainly work with .NET MVC. Prior to starting this job, I knew very little about .NET, MVC and C#, however I feel like I've learned a lot from being thrown in the deep end and immersing myself as much as possible. This has been supplemented by a great learning environment, including technical programming discussions, 'programming book club', code reviews etc.

Additionally, we started a project using Xamarin Forms to create an iOS application and leave room for an Android version down the line. Xamarin uses C# and is quite similar to .NET in many ways, so this has been invaluable to my learning and has been great fun. I've also taken on the role of Scrum Master in my team, which has been exciting and a lot of fun, not to mention very busy! I feel I've improved on my social skills and love being across things happening in our team and throughout the wider team as well.

At Image Centre I was involved in many projects - sometimes making small tweaks to existing websites, and at other times building templates and customising themes in Shopify and WordPress. I learned a lot from the people around me, who have varied interests and areas of skill. Through peer learning and following many a tutorial, I’ve become familiar and confident with writing and setting up SASS, as well as writing and reading basic Javascript and jQuery. I’ve also become familiar with Git, both via command line and GUI applications, and have of course increased my skills in HTML, including working with templates written for Django, Liquid (mostly for the Shopify platform) and some WordPress.

As Image Centre is an agency for everything from web to billboards to magazines, I dealt with many different types of clients and therefore spent some of my time providing customer support, via phone, email and through services like Zendesk. This also means I often had multiple projects a day and as such I’ve become accustomed to balancing time spent on each project, so everything gets done in a reasonable timeframe.

Before Spike, I completed a Diploma of 3D Animation at Media Design School with merit. For my final project I received an Industry Award for texturing. While the focus was of course on 3D animation, I learned many skills that have impacted my work positively, regardless of the type of job, such as the ability to work comfortably with deadlines, to handle criticism in a constructive way, to judge priorities and work accordingly.

Thank you for your time and please feel free to contact me at any time.
