      "__content": "\nIt's mashup time! As I [teased a few days ago](/blog/personal%20work/2014/03/20/drawing-progress-mashup-time/), I've been working on a T-shirt design this week. I can now reveal that it's a mashup between Scott Pilgrim and Dark Souls.\n\nAs it is a mashup of a movie (based on a comic) and a video game, I realise that not everybody will get this reference, so let me explain:\n\n> In Scott Pilgrim vs. The World (the movie), Scott Pilgrim has a crush on Ramona Flowers, but before he can date her he needs to defeat her 7 evil exes. One of them is Roxie Richter, her only evil ex *girlfriend*. When they meet, she says to Scott: &#8220;Prepare to die, obviously.&#8221;\n> \n> Dark Souls is a video game, renowned for its difficulty and high probability of players' characters being killed many times over for the duration of that game. Therefore, they have adapted the tagline &#8220;Prepare To Die.&#8221;\n\nCombining both of those things, I got this! I hope you like it.\n\nI've also submitted the image to <a href=\"http://www.teefury.com/\" target=\"_blank\">TeeFury</a> so who knows, you might be able to buy the T-shirt sometime soon!\n\n [1]: http://thecrypt.co.nz/category/blog/drawing-progress-mashup-time/ \"Drawing in Progress: Mashup time!\"",
