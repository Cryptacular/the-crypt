I've also added more lighting from different directions (fill light and rim light as I talked about in the previous post) and fixed up some of the darker bits in the light coming out of the gun.\n\nHave a look:\n\n![Boktai of Doom - Draft](/img/blog/boktai-v2/boktai-of-doom-v5-259x300.jpg)\n\nI've also started sketching out the elements I want to put around Django, including Otenko (the sunflower, his mentor) and some of the enemies and UI from the game. A photo below:\n\n![Boktai of Doom - Draft](/img/blog/boktai-v2/2014-03-06-23.07.49-2-255x300.jpg)\n\nStay tuned!\n",
