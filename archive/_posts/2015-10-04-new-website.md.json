However, I was never entirely happy with it, plus WordPress is a bit bloaty. Aside from that, I felt a refresh in design was due as well!\n\nSo, I've decided to go with <a href=\"http://jekyllrb.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jekyll</a>! It's basically a CMS for developers, but without the conventional CMS. It works with a Ruby gem installed on your local machine (or server if you have access to it via ssh) and you upload the files it generates via FTP.\n\nIt gives you much more freedom as a developer to tweak your site and add and update templates, all without a slow, bulky CMS. It's great!\n\nOn that note, though, I've had to export all my previous posts from WordPress and convert them to Markdown format. The brunt of the work was done via a plugin, but most posts still need some cleaning up. So, for now this blog will be a little empty, but I will start adding them back in over the next little while.\n\nFor the time being, you can see most of my portfolio on my [Behance](http://behance.net/nickmertens/) page.\n\nNew features, projects and more will all be posted here so keep an eye out :)\n\nThanks for reading!",
