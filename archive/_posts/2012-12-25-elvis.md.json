The cat depicted is a caricature of her cat called Elvis, which is also why I drew him as Elvis Presley.\n\nI researched photos of Elvis Presley in order to get the clothes right. I also posed a 3D model in the position I wanted (for which I used Maya) and used this as reference for the final drawing.\n\nDrawn on paper, painted in Photoshop.\n",
