This 3D piece was created in 12 weeks. All modelling, texturing, lighting, rendering and all concept art was done by myself.

The first 4 weeks was spent on pre-production, including brainstorming, creating mood boards and producing concept art on paper and in Photoshop.

The following 8 weeks I spent on modelling, texturing and lighting the scene, as well as painting the background.

I received an industry award for excellence in texturing on this project.

Created in Maya, Photoshop and After Effects.
