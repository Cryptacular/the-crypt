This is one pissed parrot. Why is he pissed? It might have something to do with those feathers there.

It all started with a few quick sketches, before settling on this one. As you can see in the progress shots below, I started by adding local colours (the base colour of a material not in light or shadow), then shadows, highlights, bounce light, a secondary light source, texture, background and lastly, depth of field.

Hope you like it! Make sure to follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Cryptacular) and [Instagram](http://instagram.com/creationsfromthecrypt/) for more art updates :)
