The Night Pandas are an illusive group of merciless pub quizzers, masters of knowledge and deception. They rarely finish in first place, because they know that it'd be too obvious and risky if they came first all the time.

So anyways, I designed this logo for my pub quiz team. I took some inspiration from Darkwing Duck. I sketched the original design in pencil, then used a Wacom tablet in Illustrator. The background was done in Photoshop.

Hope you like it!
