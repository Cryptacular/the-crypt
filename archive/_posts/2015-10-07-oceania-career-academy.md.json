They have partnered with The Fono and it has been set up to upskill students in various trades.\n\nBased on a previous website design by [Far Beyond Creative](http://farbeyond.co.nz), I created this design for their email newsletter. It includes multiple different sections and layouts the client can pick and choose from.\n\nOnce signed off, I built the email from the ground up for [MailChimp](http://mailchimp.com/). It allows the user to create a new campaign and start adding different sections as they see fit. Almost all images and text blocks are editable.\n\nThe design is also mobile responsive. You can compare the desktop and mobile versions here:\n\n![Desktop vs. Mobile](/img/blog/oca/mailchimp-desktop-mobile.png)\n\nSee the announcement of Oceania Career Academy on [The Fono website](http://www.thefono.org/services-fees/education/oceania-career-academy/).",
