A few weeks ago, a good friend of mine decided to start his own marketing company, aimed at helping the little guy achieve big things, having some fun and making a great impression along the way.

He asked me to create a logo for Rocco Douglas, and when he gave me his logo pitch, it turned out we had already been thinking along the same lines!

After a few iterations, we came up with the version so here today. The main version is up above as the featured image and this has a blackboard-like texture, so will suit most digital media. For print, large format and dark backgrounds, I created the versions below.
