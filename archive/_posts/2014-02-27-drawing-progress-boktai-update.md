Slowly but surely my Doom cover-style Boktai drawing is coming along. I've added more shading, based on a weak light-source in the top-right of the image. I've repainted the hair to look more natural and I've redone some of the line art. I've also changed the lettering to the Doom font, through a little plugin I found [here](http://fontmeme.com/doom-font/).

Next: I will add shading based on a fill light (possibly located in the middle-left of the image), shading based on a rim light (located behind Django) and I will of course add colour and texture to the "Boktai" text, similar to the Doom cover, and make the letters 3-dimensional.
