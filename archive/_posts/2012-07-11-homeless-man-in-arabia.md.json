All modelling, texturing, lighting, rendering and all concept art was done by myself.\n\nThe first 4 weeks was spent on pre-production, including brainstorming, creating mood boards and producing concept art on paper and in Photoshop.\n\nThe following 8 weeks I spent on modelling, texturing and lighting the scene, as well as painting the background.\n\nI received an industry award for excellence in texturing on this project.\n\nCreated in Maya, Photoshop and After Effects.\n\n![Concept](/img/blog/homeless-man/homeless-man-concept.jpg)\n\n![Orthographic](/img/blog/homeless-man/homeless-man-ortho.jpg)\n\n![Scroll](/img/blog/homeless-man/homeless-man-scroll.jpg)\n\n![Background](/img/blog/homeless-man/homeless-man-bg.jpg)\n",
