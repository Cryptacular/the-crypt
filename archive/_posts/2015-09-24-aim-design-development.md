## Website Design and Development in WordPress

Working closely with the client, I designed this one-page scrolling website with parallax images.

Then, after a few iterations and final approval, I worked on the front end development through WordPress. See below wireframes and final designs.

You can visit the website here: [assetim.com.au](http://assetim.com.au).

View the wireframe & final design below:
