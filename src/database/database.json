      "content": "\nA little while ago I looked through my old GBA games and started playing Boktai: Solar Boy Django again. For those who don't know the game (I'm not actually sure how well-known it was!) it's a stealth-action game where you use the power of the sun against the undead. The cool thing about the game however, is that the game cartridge has a solar cell on it that measured the intensity of the sun, which directly affects an energy bar in-game. The sun is basically your ammunition, getting players to play games outside!\n\n![Boktai cartridge](/img/blog/boktai/boktai-300x226.jpg)\n\nAnyways, so I started playing this game again and I remembered how much I loved it. I also noticed how well it holds up today with its stealth mechanics. I decided I'd start a drawing of the main character Django in my own style. I also thought it would be cool to imitate the original Doom game cover, so Django is in a similar pose.\n\n![Doom cover](/img/blog/boktai/doom-cover.jpg)\n\nI am also planning on redrawing the Boktai logo in the Doom style of lettering.\n\nSee below for some sketches:\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" width=\"550\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\n    Preview of a new drawing I'm working on.

I can now reveal that it's a mashup between Scott Pilgrim and Dark Souls.\n\nAs it is a mashup of a movie (based on a comic) and a video game, I realise that not everybody will get this reference, so let me explain:\n\n> In Scott Pilgrim vs. The World (the movie), Scott Pilgrim has a crush on Ramona Flowers, but before he can date her he needs to defeat her 7 evil exes. One of them is Roxie Richter, her only evil ex *girlfriend*. When they meet, she says to Scott: &#8220;Prepare to die, obviously.&#8221;\n> \n> Dark Souls is a video game, renowned for its difficulty and high probability of players' characters being killed many times over for the duration of that game. Therefore, they have adapted the tagline &#8220;Prepare To Die.&#8221;\n\nCombining both of those things, I got this! I hope you like it.\n\nI've also submitted the image to <a href=\"http://www.teefury.com/\" target=\"_blank\">TeeFury</a> so who knows, you might be able to buy the T-shirt sometime soon!\n\n [1]: http://thecrypt.co.nz/category/blog/drawing-progress-mashup-time/ \"Drawing in Progress: Mashup time!\"",

It was designed in-house and then given to me for the front-end development.  \nThe e-commerce store is built on the Shopify platform and was loosely based on an existing theme and customised from there.  \nOne of the main challenges with this website was the recurring payment system. Customers have the option to get a certain selection of products delivered to their door every so many weeks, as per their choosing. However, in order to accept these recurring payments via credit cards, we had to use an existing plugin, which connected to a number of services.\n\nHowever, only one of these services was available in New Zealand: BrainTree. To make matters worse, the service had only just launched here, so it was still in beta and we were advised we were the first clients to use it. This being both exciting and scary, we got stuck in and made it work.\n\nYou can visit the site here: <a href=\"http://thebabybag.co.nz\" target=\"_blank\">thebabybag.co.nz</a>.\n\nSee below for a screenshot of the final website:\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-446\" alt=\"The Baby Bag\" src=\"/img/wp-uploads/2015/09/The-Baby-Bag.png\" width=\"1270\" height=\"4239\" />",

However, I was never entirely happy with it, plus WordPress is a bit bloaty. Aside from that, I felt a refresh in design was due as well!\n\nSo, I've decided to go with <a href=\"http://jekyllrb.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jekyll</a>! It's basically a CMS for developers, but without the conventional CMS. It works with a Ruby gem installed on your local machine (or server if you have access to it via ssh) and you upload the files it generates via FTP.\n\nIt gives you much more freedom as a developer to tweak your site and add and update templates, all without a slow, bulky CMS. It's great!\n\nOn that note, though, I've had to export all my previous posts from WordPress and convert them to Markdown format. The brunt of the work was done via a plugin, but most posts still need some cleaning up. So, for now this blog will be a little empty, but I will start adding them back in over the next little while.\n\nFor the time being, you can see most of my portfolio on my [Behance](http://behance.net/nickmertens/) page.\n\nNew features, projects and more will all be posted here so keep an eye out :)\n\nThanks for reading!",

      "content": "\n\nI’m a Junior Software Developer Slash Scrum Master. Only two of those words are actually in my job title, but that’s basically what I do.\n\nI started this journey in a very different place. My first job outside retail was at a small email marketing agency called Spike. I had some HTML experience already, though minimal email coding experience, which turned out to be a whole different beast. They took me under their wing, however, and soon I had a firm grip of coding for email.\n\nI moved on to a hybrid role of about 60% email marketing and 40% front end development at a creative agency called Image Centre Group, now known simply as ICG. I was introduced to the wonders of JavaScript and circled around the strange world of backend development. Communication skills skyrocketed as I was in hot demand throughout the business, being the sole person looking after email marketing for about 40 clients.\n\nA brief reprieve at a car rental company, where miscommunication led to a role misadvertised. We won’t talk about this lapse in judgement on both sides.\n\nThen I joined the ranks of software developers at Fisher & Paykel Healthcare and my little monkey brain just about exploded. I was thrown into the deep end of C# backend development, JavaScript development using Kendo, unit testing, Agile and more specifically Scrum. I am surrounded by people who have learned a great deal over the years, who are willing to share this knowledge, and who are still thirsting for more knowledge. And to top it all off, I put up my hand to be a Scrum Master during my first or second month, a decision made very much in the moment, mostly because I wanted to be proactive and try something new. It’s a decision that has affected my time at this company a great deal, but I believe it has only been positive.\n\nComing from a background of mostly waterfall management, Scrum was certainly eye opening to me. I’m not going to pretend I’m suddenly a guru on all things Agile, but I’m learning quickly, and I would like to share this learning journey with you, o’ reader who has made it this far down the article!\n\nThe last week or two have been especially crucial. My manager and I went to a local meetup about Agile basics and mingled a little afterwards with some of the other attendees. Something that really resonated with me during the presentation is that Scrum in particular is brutally honest. It’s all about transparency and making decisions around impediments, issues, and making sure things go as smoothly as possible.\n\nJust the other day I met up with a fellow Scrum Master in the company, who led me through some of his recurring responsibilities and activities. There is of course the facilitating of Scrum ceremonies — sprint planning, sprint review, sprint retrospective — and making sure stand up happens every morning, but there’s much more to it than I initially realised.\n\nA big part of your job as Scrum Master comes down to looking after your team. Not in the way a project manager might, but more like a good friend. You look out for them, try and mediate conflicts, remove any obstacles the team might run into, be a first point of contact for people outside the team, and so on. Because you are not a manager, you’re part of the team. Especially when you’re half Scrum Master, half developer like me.\n\nAs I mentioned at the start of this article, I’m a Junior Dev and a Junior Scrum Master, so I’m looking for any opportunities to improve. What has your experience been with Scrum? What have you appreciated in a Scrum Master, or what did you wish they did? What about those of you who have been in the role of Scrum Master yourselves, what have your experiences been like? Let me know in the comments below!\n\nUntil next time.\n",

      "content": "\n\nRecently I’ve been doing a lot of reading about the responsibilities of a Scrum Master. As I [mentioned in my last post](https://medium.com/@Cryptacular/junior-dev-hour-the-origin-story-ebe1e75141e9#.au179wg54), I’m still pretty new at this stuff.\n\nFalling through a myriad of rabbit holes, metaphorically speaking, and going through [this massive list of Scrum Master tasks](http://agiletrail.com/2011/11/14/42-tasks-for-a-scrum-masters-job/), I eventually ended up on [this article about Niko Niko calendars](http://agiletrail.com/2011/09/12/how-to-track-the-teams-mood-with-a-niko-niko-calendar/).\n\nI had personally never heard about them, though I don’t doubt they’re pretty common in Agile environments. At a basic level, they’re a way for you and your team to record their daily moods.\n\nAs our team uses Slack fairly regularly for conversations, I set up a simple poll with the question at hand (“How was your day?”) and 5 options: a range of emojis from “Great!” to “Awful! I want to go home”. This is my poll stub:\n\n`\n/poll “How was your day today? Feel free to add a comment as well.” “:smile: Great!” “:slightly_smiling_face: Pretty good” “:confused: Average / confused” “:disappointed: Bad” “:anguished: Awful! I want to go home”\n`\n\nAt first glance this might sound a little pointless, as you can usually tell how someone’s feeling right? Wrong. I’ve been putting this technique to use for about a week now and I’ve been very surprised by the outcomes. I won’t go into anyone’s actual feelings, as this is of course confidential, but we’ve already identified a pain point focused around an third-party vendor.\n\nI’ve implemented the calendar a little differently to what the article describes. They suggest you print out or draw a grid with dates and let each team member write down their mood. However, I’m not so sure if this is the best approach. I understand that Scrum is all about transparency, but I believe some people just won’t express their true feelings if it’s displayed in front of everyone else.\n\nSo, instead I’ve set up a Google Sheets document with dates, team members and predefined mood options, plus some statistics on average, lowest and highest moods. It’ll be interesting to see the long-term results!\n\nI’ve set up a sample (empty) doc if you’re interested in using it.
