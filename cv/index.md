## <a name="personal-summary"></a>Personal Summary
 
My name is Nick Mertens and I'm a hard-working, creative, loyal and honest guy, with a good sense of humour. I have developed a keen interest in front end development, after starting my career as an email marketer. As I learned the ropes of email marketing and it’s very strange coding practices, I started leaning increasingly more towards front end development, as it’s an area that is constantly and quickly evolving.

After a little over a year and a half at Spike, I felt I needed more of a challenge and wanted more time with front end projects, so when I got offered the job of Junior Front End Developer & Email Marketing Specialist at Image Centre Group, I felt it was a great opportunity to showcase my skills in email marketing and fast-track my training in front end development.

At Image Centre I was involved in many projects - sometimes making small tweaks to existing websites, and at other times building templates and customising themes in Shopify and WordPress. I learned a lot from the people around me, who have varied interests and areas of skill. Through peer learning and following many a tutorial, I’ve become familiar and confident with writing and setting up SASS, as well as writing and reading basic Javascript and jQuery. I’ve also become familiar with Git, both via command line and GUI applications, and have of course increased my skills in HTML, including working with templates written for Django, Liquid (mostly for the Shopify platform) and some WordPress.

As Image Centre is an agency for everything from web to billboards to magazines, I dealt with many different types of clients and therefore spent some of my time providing customer support, via phone, email and through services like Zendesk. This also means I often had multiple projects a day and as such I’ve become accustomed to balancing time spent on each project, so everything gets done in a reasonable timeframe.

Currently I’m employed at Avis Budget Group as Digital Technician. When I was offered this job, I believed it to be a hybrid job of front end development and web content editing, with a large amount of responsibility and freedom to improve the Avis and Budget sites and work on other related projects. However, this has turned out to be almost entirely web content editing. Thus, wanting more of a challenge and more responsibility, I believe it’s time to look elsewhere, hence you’re reading this!

Before Spike I completed a Diploma of 3D Animation at Media Design School with merit. For my final project I received an Industry Award for texturing. While the focus was of course on 3D animation, I learned many skills that have impacted my work positively, regardless of the type of job, such as the ability to work comfortably with deadlines, to handle criticism in a constructive way, to judge priorities and work accordingly.

Thank you for your time and please feel free to contact me at any time.
