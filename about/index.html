<h1>I am <span class="dark-green font-weight-bold">Nick Mertens</span></h1>
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>Hope you're well, thanks for spending a few minutes of your time on my site! To tell you a little bit about myself, I'm a front end developer, email marketer, designer, illustrator and 3D animator. A bit of a mouthful, I know!</p>
<p>There are a few very different fields in that list, but my main focus is front end development, while my roots lie in email marketing. I started at <a href="http://spikehq.com/" target="_blank">Spike</a> as an email marketer and transitioned into front end development from there, at an agency called <a href="http://www.icg.co.nz/" target="_blank">Image Centre Group</a> and also freelance through <a href="http://farbeyond.co.nz/" target="_blank">Far Beyond Creative</a>.</p>
<p>So, if you need anything done that fits loosely in the above categories, be sure to give me a yell through the contact details below. Other than that, I'm a big fan of gaming, some nerdy stuff, metal music and books. I've also got my own <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX6nykQNcP0aSBz11ADdptQ" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> where I casually play games for your entertainment!</p>
<p>While you're at it, check out my <a href="https://www.patreon.com/nickmertens">Patreon page</a> where I digitally busk with art ;)</p>
<p>I'm pretty easy-going, so if you have any questions, just give me a yell!</p>
